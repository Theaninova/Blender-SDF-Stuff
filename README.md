# Thea's SDFs

This is a collection of the random stuff I've made in the past using SDFs (some may not be that).

Most of the SDF primitives are adapted from [Inigo Quilez :: 2D distance functions](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/).

Over the years I built a rather extensive library of helper functions, which might be helpful to you.

Feel free to use any of these as reference, use the functions, or show them off if you want,
as long as you don't use the logos as yours (some I don't even own), and if you're nice credit
me by linking this repo.

Everything you see in this repo is just purely me messing around, I never did this professionally
nor did I ever get paid to do this, I just did this for fun.

I hope this is useful to someone.
